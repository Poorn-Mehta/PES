# Repository Overview

**Project Description:** Real-time cross-platform Linux based UI for an Embedded System that provides data acquisition, handling and processing capabilities.

Built a real-time cross-platform UI for an Embedded System that provides the user with several help commands and controlled processes for a defined set of application specific computing tasks. Embedded C, GIT and Makefile were a few resources that were used apart from the Linux environment. Realized a real-time embedded system that can use certain peripherals like ADC, UART, DMA and system features like Circular Buffers to accept a signal and process it as per the user-defined processing constraints. For the projects, the NXP FRDM platform was utilized.
