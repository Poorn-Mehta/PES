Errors/Issues:

1. The loop repeats twice as opposed to once.
2. Issues with Psuedo-random number storage.
3. Addition of timing loop to Psuedo Generator function is still pending.
4. Adding complexity where if the user enters an address which is close to the
   boundary of the memory allocated then he/she should be warned that not all 
   data will be stored since the width of the storage space beginning from the
   starting of the address for storage to the allocation limit.

address - Relative and real
Boundary Check
Time involvement in every function
